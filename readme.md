# Prioritization framework

## Background
* Phase A: Decide on a target region (farming system x country), recognizing donor interests
* Phase B: Identify partners, technologies + enablers within these target regions
* Phase C: Assess ex-ante impact (technology-related, farmer segmentation, enablers)

### Phase A: Prioritization logic 
* Farming systems
* National
* Value chains and markets
* Communities & households
* Innovation entry points
